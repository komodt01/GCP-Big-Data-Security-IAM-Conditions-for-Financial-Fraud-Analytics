# Business Case: Financial Fraud Access Governance

Financial institutions are required to enforce strict controls on when and how analysts access sensitive datasets. This project addresses that need by:

- Ensuring data in BigQuery is only accessible during business hours
- Preventing off-hours and weekend access to reduce risk of unauthorized data exposure
- Demonstrating zero-trust-aligned, context-aware access without requiring external tooling
